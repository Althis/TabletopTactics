# Motivation
While exploring the idea of Physical Design, we started looking towards which player fantasies would be best suited to exemplify the concept. We immediatelly thought of strategy games, where the fantasy is that the player steps into the shoes of a powerful general.

To achieve that, we used the metaphor of a warroom. In our game, the player would see the battlefield through a map, much like older generals, and through the magic of VR, this map would come to life mimicking the imagination of an expert. When coming up with the necessary means of interaction, we looked at scenes from movies and pictures to see what kind of physical objects were available to characters in these circunstances. For example, we explored the idea of using statuettes, but ultimately decided going with tiny banners since squads of units could be formed by multiple kinds of units and having a hybrid squad represented by an archer would could be confusing.

# The Struggle
The project was greatly harmed by the balancing act between it and our multiple other semester activities. Map assymetry, recruitment mechanics, a two player mode(desktop vs VR), and fog of war were all features that had to be cut due to time constraints. Availability of the VR hardware was also another problem, as we only managed to gain access to our final setup 24 hours before the final presentation. Despite that, many corners had to be cut, and the game suffered as a result. It really goes to show, however, how simple the VR setup in Unity3D is, that even with that short time we were able to implement most of the desired VR functionality without a hitch. Since we had no artists in this project, we did what we could through assets from the Unity Asset store. What we couldn't buy, João Lucas did his best to hack with his limited experience with 3D programs and animation.

# The Result
The result is more of a very short proof of concept than a proper demo as we would like. In it, the cathedral of the town has been taken by an enemy army, and continuously spawns more soldiers. Once they reach a certain number, they will attack and invade the player town. The player starts with an army that is not strong enough to defeat them, and much capture more buildings that produce friendly units on the other side of the map. Once with a strong enough army, the player must make good use of tactics(unit placement and squad composition) to defeat the enemy army and retake the cathedral.

# Future
The continuation of this project is iffy. While multiple members of the team agree it is a great idea, we are unable to work on it properly without the VR hardware, and the whole point of the project becomes moot without it. If eventually we gain access to the hardware again, we would very much like to finish the missing features(specially the 2 player mode), do some more playtesting.
